A web server for YARV.

Features:
 - rack interface

 - persistant and pipelined requests

 - async uploads, each request is in a fiber and will magically yield if you
   try to read from the request body but the data hasn't arrived yet. (like
   for large uploads.) to you env['rack.input'] blocks but in reality it never
   blocks.  Uploads are not buffered.

 - responses can also be streamed. see async_example.rb for an example
   the api for this is subject to change. 

 - the event loop is exposed, combining your own event loop watchers with
   async responses allows you to do access the database without blocking

 - supports chunked requests and responses. 
   chunked requests are transparent - it just happens
   chunked responses are done when the response header 
   'Transfer-Encoding' => 'chunked' is set (case-sensitive) 

requires REV!! (which is written by Tony Arcieri)

uses the parser from libebb http://tinyclouds.org/libebb/ which is based on
Mongrel's parser
